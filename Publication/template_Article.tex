This work will analyze earthquake data provided by the Los Alamos National Laboratory. We will create a model to predict earthquakes and win a Kaggle competition.

\section{Problem Statement}
%
Earthquakes cause deaths and massive damage. They are difficult to predict relative to other natural disasters. This analysis aims to produce a model which will predict earthquakes more accurately than TBD   \dots

\subsection{Experiment Design}
%
Data will be attained from a Kaggle Competition sponsored by the Los Alamos National Laboratory:  www.kaggle.com/c/LANL-Earthquake-Prediction. Because the data in this competition is simulated we may need to pursue real data from an alternate source. This will be determined after consultation with our advisor and instructor.
